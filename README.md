## Getting Started

You can follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager

### Installation

1. Star the repository.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nixrajput/social-media-api-nodejs.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd social-media-api-nodejs
   ```

4. Install the project dependencies:

   If you're using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If you're using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   If you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   If you're using bun:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

### Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the environment variables. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the necessary values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Database Setup

Make sure you have a database configured and running. Update the database connection details in the `.env.local` file.

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and the configuration is set up, you can start the application by running:

```bash
npm run dev
#or
pnpm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun run dev
```

By default, the application will run on port `3000`. You can change the port by modifying the `PORT` environment variable in the `.env.local` file.

## API Documentation

### Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To authenticate, send a POST request to `/api/v2/auth/login` with a JSON payload containing the user's email and password.

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password"
}
```

If the credentials are valid, the API will respond with a JWT token, which should be included in subsequent requests as an Authorization header:

```json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Endpoints

#### Auth

- **POST /api/v1/auth/register**: Create a new account.
- **POST /api/v1/auth/login**: Login to the account.

#### Profile

- **GET /api/v1/profile/me**: Get profile details.
- **GET /api/v1/profile/:id**: Get profile details by ID.

## Deployment

This API can be deployed using various platforms such as Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or your own server infrastructure. Here are some general steps to deploy the API:

1. **Prepare your environment**: Ensure that your deployment environment meets the requirements specified in the Prerequisites section.

2. **Build the application**: If necessary, build the TypeScript code into JavaScript. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**: Set up environment variables similar to how it's done in the local setup. Ensure that you provide appropriate values for your deployment environment.

4. **Deploy the application**: Deploy the built application to your chosen platform. Each platform may have its own deployment process. Refer to the documentation of your chosen platform for detailed instructions.

5. **Start the application**: Once deployed, start the application in your deployment environment. This might involve running a command similar to `npm start` or `yarn start`, depending on your setup.

6. **Monitor the deployment**: Monitor the deployed application for any issues. Make sure that it's running smoothly and handle any errors or performance issues as needed.
